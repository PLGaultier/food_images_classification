# food_images_classification
Predict for unseen triplets (A, B, C) whether dish A is more similar in taste to B or C.

The task is the following: for each triplet (A, B, C) in test_triplets.txt you should predict 0 or 1 as follows:
1 if the dish in image A.jpg is closer in taste to the dish in image B.jpg than to the dish in C.jpg
0 if the dish in image A.jpg is closer in taste to the dish in image C.jpg than to the dish in B.jpg

The submission will be compared to judgements produced by human annotators and the accuracy will be measured.
